          Logging daemons are present on each node that BigBang is installed on.  Out of the box, the following events are captured:

          * all containers emitting to STDOUT or STDERR (captured  by container runtime translating container logs to /var/log/containers)
          * all kubernetes api server requests 
          * all events emitted by the kubelet

        description: >-
          Records captured by the logging daemon are enriched to  ensure the following are always present:

          * time of the event (UTC)
          * source of event (pod, namespace, container id)

          Applications are responsible for providing all other information.
